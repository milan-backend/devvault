# 🚀 DevVault — Secure Environment Manager for Developers

DevVault is a developer-focused tool that simplifies how environment variables (`.env` files) are managed across projects and machines.

Instead of manually creating and sharing `.env` files, DevVault allows you to securely store secrets and generate `.env` files instantly using a CLI.

---

## ❗ Problem

Managing environment variables is messy and error-prone:

* Rewriting `.env` files for every project
* Sharing secrets insecurely (WhatsApp, email, etc.)
* Missing keys when switching devices
* Manual copy-paste every time

---

## ✅ Solution

DevVault provides:

* 🔐 Secure storage for secrets
* 📦 Project-based environment management
* ⚡ CLI tool to instantly generate `.env` files
* 🧩 Centralized system for developers

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔹 Step 1 — Setup (One-Time)

Using API (Swagger UI):

1. Signup
2. Create a project
3. Add secrets (key-value pairs)

---

### 🔹 Step 2 — Daily Usage

Using CLI:

```bash
devvault login <email> <password>
devvault pull <project_name>
```

👉 This automatically generates a `.env` file.

---

## 🧠 Example

Instead of writing:

```env
DATABASE_URL=...
SECRET_KEY=...
API_KEY=...
```

You just run:

```bash
devvault pull backend_project
```

👉 `.env` is generated instantly.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* FastAPI (Backend API)
* PostgreSQL (Database)
* SQLAlchemy (ORM)
* JWT Authentication
* Fernet Encryption (Secrets)
* Python CLI (Typer + Requests)

---

## 🔐 Security

DevVault is built with security as a core principle:

* 🔒 All secrets are encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption) before storing in the database
* ❌ Secrets are never stored in plaintext
* 🔑 Encryption key is managed via environment variables (`.env`)
* 🔐 JWT-based authentication for all protected endpoints
* 🧑‍💻 Project-level access control (users can only access their own projects and secrets)
* 🚫 `.env` files and tokens are excluded using `.gitignore`
